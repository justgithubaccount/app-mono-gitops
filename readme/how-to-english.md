### ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step Immersion Flow (Formal Style)

1. **Listening & Reading (Input)**

   * Watch shows/podcasts *with English subtitles*
   * Read graded books or simple articles
   * Focus on understanding meaning â€” *not translating*

2. **Vocabulary**

   * Use **monolingual dictionaries** (Longman/Oxford)
   * Practice with **Anki** (SRS method)
   * Learn words in context, not as isolated translations

3. **Grammar Structure**

   * Use clear SVO-based sentences:
     *(Subject â†’ Verb â†’ Object)*
   * Study formal grammar from books like *English Grammar in Use*

4. **Writing & Speaking (Output)**

   * Donâ€™t rush â€” speak/write **only after enough input**
   * Write simple texts first: emails, journal entries
   * Later: use polite/formal structures (no contractions, clear verbs)

5. **Consistency**

   * Daily practice (30â€“90 minutes)
   * Stay in the language: think, listen, read â€” in English
